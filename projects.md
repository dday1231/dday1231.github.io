### HTML 5 Canvas Clock
[An analog clock using only HTML5 and Javascript.](https://dday1231.github.io/ClockFaceChallenge.html)

This was a coding challenge that involved using some trigonometry, HTML5, and Javascript to build an analog clock face that keeps accurate time.
I worked on this challenge a few hours each day for approximately 3 days. Most of the project time was spent in refining my understanding of how the seconds, minutes, and hour hands must move together in correct proportions, and to get the hour hand to move smoothly for a realistic look.
