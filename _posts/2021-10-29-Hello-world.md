This blog is my accountability partner, rubber duck, sounding board, stenographer, teacher, and student.

This blog is a place to put ideas and concepts into my own words, so as to increase my memory and understanding of them.

This blog is a place to structure and refine my thoughts on various topics. 

A place to record seeminly important, but unstructured information, like a link to a promising book or course I'd like to work through in the future.

A side effect of blogging will be to see my progress, or lack thereof, in a particular project, share information with others, and create a repository of personal learning.

I'll stop prognosticating and pigeonholing this blog now.

Let's see where this goes. I want to see it grow and develop into something I could not have possibly imagined as I sit here in my backyard writing my first blog post.
